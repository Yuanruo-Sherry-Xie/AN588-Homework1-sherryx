-   Hi there!

-   In this repo you should see the following:

    -   unprettified orignial code (r markdown)

    -   (NOT CURRENTLY AVALIABLE) HTML file of the original code \^ (STRUGGLING TO KNIT...)

    -   prettified code based off of the original code \^

    -   random-people csv

-   currently MISSING:

    -   HTML files because r keeps on telling me library stringr does not exist and I can not knit the file

-   My unprettified code which incorporates notes from modules 3 and 4, as well as all the challenges from module 4

-   each section should be the title/ header before the notes and code are shown

-   I have comments in my code sections to help my readers and myself understand what's going on or my thought process in general, let me know if they are confusing

Thanks for reading this!
